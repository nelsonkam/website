A vision of a thriving Africa. An Africa where survival is not paramount, where the youth can dream and fulfill their dreams within the continent. Africa&#39;s population keeps growing, and its issues with it. Unfortunately, this trend is here to stay, and we can&#39;t afford to standby while the bomb is ticking. </p><p> We have all complained time and time again about how hard it is to build something that makes a difference on the continent, calling out all the obstacles we have faced on our journey and mostly blaming the generations before us, the government, and what not as the reason our failures. I get it, I&#39;ve been there, and there&#39;s some merit to that. However, I believe that we should do something about it. I can&#39;t imagine being 50 and hearing kids saying the same things we&#39;re saying now about their dreams, bringing up the same reasons for why they can&#39;t succeed. I refuse to live in such a future that would be an utter failure. For this reason, I believe our generation is uniquely positioned to make a difference, make things right, and make things better because if not us, who? If not now, when? </p><p> All revolutions start with one person, and all big changes start with the individual. We have to be the change we want to see, and we have to impersonate that change. In other words, we have to do the work, starting from what we&#39;re doing today, to get to that dream. It doesn&#39;t help to just dream of a better Africa; we have to be better ourselves. How can we even pretend to make a change if we have nothing to show for it, if we&#39;re not even prepared for what&#39;s ahead? </p><p> We&#39;ve given ourselves the mission to make this continent a thriving one. Let&#39;s not fool ourselves; we&#39;re going to war, and we can&#39;t go to war with broomsticks and lovely slogans expecting victory. Victory can only be ours if we are fully prepared and take the years ahead to slowly but surely stack up the weaponry that will lead us to victory. There can be no excuses because failure is not an option. We will have to work tirelessly towards our goal because we will be the only ones to blame if we don&#39;t fulfill our mission. Africa is ours, Africa needs us, Africa deserves to be thriving. However, it doesn&#39;t care about efforts. Change is always welcomed with ardent resistance, but change is imperative. </p><blockquote> We are the sons and daughters of all the freedom fighters <br>And there are still many rivers to cross <br>Hands in the air, screaming loud and clear for freedom, justice and equality <br>There is no black or white, there is only right and wrong <br>We are unknown heroes, we are flesh and we are blood <br>We are the great future <br>We need to get back to the joy of living <br>We are five fingers of an empty hand <br>But together, we can also be the fist <br>Sometimes change can be as simple as two hands reaching for one another Clap your hands<br><br>‚Äî <em>Imany (Silver lining)</em></blockquote><p><em><strong>For a better Africa...</strong></em><br>It&#39;s up to <strong>us</strong>. </p></div></div></section></main></div><!--]--></div>
