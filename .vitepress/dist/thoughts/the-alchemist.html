I must say I absolutely loved it. The story of the boy, Santiago, spoke a lot to me as I am at a point where I feel a bit lost as I have lost interest in my work at Beans and I&#39;m trying to figure out what to do next. I am considering traveling, going to another country to live new experiences and get closer to the things I love. It&#39;s just an idea for now but who knows maybe along the way I might learn something new and figure out more stuff about my journey like Santiago.</p><p>My dream stays the same, I would love to see more young Africans succeed. It&#39;s that simple. I&#39;d love to leverage the few things I have, to contribute to making it easier for my mates and future generations of Africans to not only dream but more importantly live their dreams. Achieving such a feat will make me content and happy but more importantly, contributing daily to that becoming reality is what I ought to live for.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t forget that an important part of the destination is the journey. It&#39;s what the destination is about: the journey. If I focus too much on the destination I&#39;ll miss out on the beauty of the journey and if I indulge way too much into the journey I might go astray and miss out on the destination. Both are important. As the wise man told the boy with the spoon of oil being able to do both is the secret to happiness.</p><p>Whatever it is that I decide to do next should help me get closer to my dream one way or the other and even though it might not always make sense now, down I might be able to connect the dots into a story. I&#39;d have to keep learning, be patient, and trust in the process, my heart, and my dreams.</p><p>The book just came in at the right time I believe. Maybe it&#39;s an omen. Who knows?</p></div></div></section></main></div><!--]--></div>
