I was so excited that I would see how plants grow for the first time, so I got my tin can put in some soil added a few beans, watered it and kept it by the roof top so it could get some sunlight. The next day, I woke up all excited to check the tin can hoping to see that my beans had grown but to my dismay the can looked exactly as I left it the day before. I was disappointed but I thought maybe it just took two days so I left the can hoping to see something the next day. Needless to say, nothing happened either. I was really confused, I was asking myself if I did anything wrong or if the beans I planted were not the type to grow, I even went as far as digging them out to see what they had turned to. I didn’t understand that the process takes time and that it would take a few weeks for my beans to grow into a thriving young plant.
