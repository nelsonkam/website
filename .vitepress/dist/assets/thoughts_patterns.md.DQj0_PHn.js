To change his pattern, he had to change his definition of himself ("Not just a rich thug"), change his perspective ("Our future is out of this damn place"), and let go (letting the boys of the LH7 be accountable for their actions). Unfortunately, the nature of repeating patterns is that they tend to repeat themselves even when we try to break out of them. So if we don't make a conscious effort to break out of those patterns, we end up repeating them. Even when we do, our immediate environment, enablers of those repeating patterns, will lure us into repeating those very same patterns.`,-1),g=t("p",null,"I think of all the times I worked on a project only to give up because I thought it wasn't going to work or because it felt too hard.
