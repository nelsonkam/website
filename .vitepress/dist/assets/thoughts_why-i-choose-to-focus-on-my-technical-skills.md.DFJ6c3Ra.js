It was my first tech conference since the start of the pandemic. I met a lot of likeminded people, made great friends and met some twitter folks in person. By all counts, it was eye-opening and enriching as it pushed me to reconsider a few things — mainly a solution to my long standing dilemma: Should I focus on my technical skills and become good at building products or should I focus more on founder-like skills (sales, networking, fundraising and so on.)?",-1),r=e("p",null,"I love building products. I love thinking through problems and being absolutely laser focused at solving said problems. Technical challenges create a sort of intense excitement in me that’s akin to incredible delight. Programming, problem solving, product thinking all spark joy for me. When I think of fundraising, network, sales I don’t feel the same. It feels forced, unnecessary and I don’t associate joy to those activities. When I attended the networking events during the ATS, it became clear to me that I couldn’t see myself doing those activities out of sheer joy, I wouldn’t enjoy it at all. I strongly believe that one can only be good at things they genuinely enjoy doing. It doesn’t feel like work and you don’t need extra motivation to get out of bed every morning because the work in itself is enough motivation. I would choose discussing a technical problem on a whiteboard or refactoring a piece of code over talking to people about potential partnerships or the future trends in my industry every single time (no doubt).",-1),h=e("p",null,"I have to come to terms with the fact that I’m a builder and although that doesn’t fit the CEO mould, I could still be an excellent product/technical founder.
