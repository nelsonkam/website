        <p class="">
          Hey there! I’m Nelson, and I love computers. I’m currently studying
          Computer Science at
          <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">University de Montréal</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          In the past, I worked a lot in the fintech space in Africa. With a
          couple of friends, I built and launched
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/72695570/">Kash</a>, a
          credit card issuing service for African consumers (think Revolut or
          Cash app, but for Africa). We grew
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/72695570/">Kash</a>
          to about 20,000 users and processed about $500K in payments. After
          that, I joined
          <a href="https://chippercash.com/">Chipper Cash</a>
          as a senior software engineer and worked on their money movement and
          crypto infrastructure. I also worked as a tech lead at
          <a href="https://www.djamo.com/">Djamo</a>, a neobank backed by
          YC-based Ivory Coast.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          After a few years of professional experience, I’ve decided to go back
          to university to study the fundamentals of my field and pursue a
          career as a researcher in AI/ML.
