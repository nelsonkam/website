<p>In <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name?ref=blog.nelsonkamga.com">Kimi no nawa</a></em>, it is said that like threads, time and realities intertwine, separate, and connect again. Similar to the notion of non-linear (but circular) time in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)?ref=blog.nelsonkamga.com">Arrival</a></em>, this is something that makes me think. What if every experience is a stepping stone for what is to come? Perhaps, in the end, there is no good or bad experience just stepping stones to what's next.</p><p>Sometimes a lot of things don't make sense as they happen but in the end, you realize that it all makes sense. As Jobs says it "You only connect the dots looking backward". Sometimes part of the journey is to have faith in the fact that tomorrow will make today worth it.</p><p>By the way, coming to think of it, I remember when I realized that some of the best things that happened to me were just random things culminating into something positive. Almost arbitrary, those things felt random when they happened but they were key to something positive down the road.</p><p>We can't plan everything in advance. Sometimes we need to accept things as they are and trust that it will all make sense in the end.</p>
