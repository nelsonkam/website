  My dream, my mission, my creed is the African dream. A vision of a thriving
  Africa. An Africa where survival is not paramount, where the youth can dream
  and fulfill their dreams within the continent. Africa's population keeps
  growing, and its issues with it. Unfortunately, this trend is here to stay,
  and we can't afford to standby while the bomb is ticking.
</p>
<p>
  We have all complained time and time again about how hard it is to build
  something that makes a difference on the continent, calling out all the
  obstacles we have faced on our journey and mostly blaming the generations
  before us, the government, and what not as the reason our failures. I get it,
  I've been there, and there's some merit to that. However, I believe that we
  should do something about it. I can't imagine being 50 and hearing kids saying
  the same things we're saying now about their dreams, bringing up the same
  reasons for why they can't succeed. I refuse to live in such a future that
  would be an utter failure. For this reason, I believe our generation is
  uniquely positioned to make a difference, make things right, and make things
  better because if not us, who? If not now, when?
</p>
<p>
  All revolutions start with one person, and all big changes start with the
  individual. We have to be the change we want to see, and we have to
  impersonate that change. In other words, we have to do the work, starting from
  what we're doing today, to get to that dream. It doesn't help to just dream of
  a better Africa; we have to be better ourselves. How can we even pretend to
  make a change if we have nothing to show for it, if we're not even prepared
  for what's ahead?
</p>
<p>
  We've given ourselves the mission to make this continent a thriving one. Let's
  not fool ourselves; we're going to war, and we can't go to war with
  broomsticks and lovely slogans expecting victory. Victory can only be ours if
  we are fully prepared and take the years ahead to slowly but surely stack up
  the weaponry that will lead us to victory. There can be no excuses because
  failure is not an option. We will have to work tirelessly towards our goal
  because we will be the only ones to blame if we don't fulfill our mission.
  Africa is ours, Africa needs us, Africa deserves to be thriving. However, it
  doesn't care about efforts. Change is always welcomed with ardent resistance,
  but change is imperative.

  We are the sons and daughters of all the freedom fighters <br />And there are
  still many rivers to cross <br />Hands in the air, screaming loud and clear
  for freedom, justice and equality <br />There is no black or white, there is
  only right and wrong <br />We are unknown heroes, we are flesh and we are
  blood <br />We are the great future <br />We need to get back to the joy of
  living <br />We are five fingers of an empty hand <br />But together, we can
  also be the fist <br />Sometimes change can be as simple as two hands reaching
  for one another Clap your hands<br /><br />â€” <em>Imany (Silver lining)</em>
