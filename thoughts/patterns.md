  Humans are repeating patterns.


  My main takeaway from the show Startup is that humans are repeating patterns.
  We

  tend to repeat the same mistakes and actions towards similar results. Izzy is

  always working towards the destruction of her work (basically self-sabotage). 

  Nick is constantly losing touch and getting all caught

We tend to repeat the same mistakes and actions towards similar results. Izzy is always working towards the destruction of her work (basically self-sabotage). Nick is constantly losing touch and getting all caught into his bubble ("All I have is Gencoin, All I have is Araknet, I am CEO, bitch"). And Ronnie keeps getting into his gang dwellings when he aspires to leave the ghetto.</p><p>Ronnie is the interesting one here because he managed to break out of his pattern only to get drawn back by Izzy at the very end. To change his pattern, he had to change his definition of himself ("Not just a rich thug"), change his perspective ("Our future is out of this damn place"), and let go (letting the boys of the LH7 be accountable for their actions). Unfortunately, the nature of repeating patterns is that they tend to repeat themselves even when we try to break out of them. So if we don't make a conscious effort to break out of those patterns, we end up repeating them. Even when we do, our immediate environment, enablers of those repeating patterns, will lure us into repeating those very same patterns.</p><p>I think of all the times I worked on a project only to give up because I thought it wasn't going to work or because it felt too hard. Unknowingly, I created a repeating pattern of starting projects and quitting just when it gets tough (Right when I realize it's going to take more effort than I initially estimated). More than habits, our repeating patterns are some sort of life subroutine that can drastically change the course of our lives.</p><p>The main question you should ask yourself is: Are my repeating patterns serving me in the right way?</p><p>You might come up with some repeating patterns that have affected your life for the worse and others for the better. Change the wrong ones by changing your perspective.</p>
