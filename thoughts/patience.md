<p>I remember when I was in primary school (elementary) I had this science project which consisted in planting and growing beans in a tin can. I was so excited that I would see how plants grow for the first time, so I got my tin can put in some soil added a few beans, watered it and kept it by the roof top so it could get some sunlight. The next day, I woke up all excited to check the tin can hoping to see that my beans had grown but to my dismay the can looked exactly as I left it the day before. I was disappointed but I thought maybe it just took two days so I left the can hoping to see something the next day. Needless to say, nothing happened either. I was really confused, I was asking myself if I did anything wrong or if the beans I planted were not the type to grow, I even went as far as digging them out to see what they had turned to. I didn’t understand that the process takes time and that it would take a few weeks for my beans to grow into a thriving young plant. I later asked my mother who then explained that the process of germination took some time and that I had to be patient to see the results of what I sowed.</p><p>In the same vein, I often forget that starting and growing successful company (or even doing anything great) takes time. In the beginning you sow in a lot of efforts but you can’t always see the results or outcomes of those efforts, it takes some time before those become apparent and it takes even longer before you can reap the fruits of your efforts. This is a long game, be patient, trust in the process and more importantly, <strong><strong>show up</strong></strong>.</p>
